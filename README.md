Etudes are small pieces of code with minimal dependecies that create self‑contained creative animations.

There are no strict rules to etudes, but here are some guidelines:
* code should be short and moderately optimized
* use of dependecies and off‑the‑shelf solutions should be minimal
* final result should be a sequence of frames that doesn’t require additional creative processing
* it shouldn’t last more than five seconds and weigh more than a few mbs

Right now, I mostly use Python’s matplotlib, numpy, and scipy to draw frames.

Etudes are different from code golfing: they should not optimise for shorter code‑length at the cost of clarity and performance. They are also different from creative coding: etudes should try to maintain a healthy balance between code quality & performance and artistic vision.

I think, with these loose constraints, etudes are a healthier and a more enjoyable alternative to coding exercises and interview questions.
